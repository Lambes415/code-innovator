# Name of the group code-innovator
 aims to explore and implement new coding paradigms, tools, and techniques to streamline the development process and enhance productivity.
# Comprehensive Patient Management System
AI-based Comprehensive Patient Management System designed to store and manage patients' medical history, such as medications, surgeries, and other significant health events. This system not only archives health records but also leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) to predict future health issues by analyzing historical data. By integrating AI, the system empowers healthcare providers to make more informed decisions, promoting proactive healthcare. 
# General info
•	Capturing and storing patient medical histories. 
•	Utilizing time series analysis to track patients' health over time. 
•	Predicting future health complications based on past medical data. 
•	Providing personalized health recommendations using AI-driven insights. 
•	Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) for text-based data extraction from health records.
